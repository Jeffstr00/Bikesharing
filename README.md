# NY CitiBike with Tableau

[My 08/2019 Citibike Challenge Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeffrey.strauch/viz/201908_Citibike_Challenge/NewYorkCitiBike "My 08/2019 Citibike Challenge Tableau Story")

## Overview

Following a fun-filled trip to New York City with our friend Kate where we used rented bicycles via CitiBike as our primary means of transportation, we begin to wonder if a similar business could be successful in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.  Kate even finds a potential angel investor who might be interested in supporting the startup.  However, before we start getting ahead of ourselves, we must do some research and try to decide if such a business would be successful back in Iowa.  In order to do that, we must first take a look at how CitiBike operates in New York.  Luckily, they have tons of information available in CSV files.  We were tasked with using that to get as much information as possible about the New York operations and then using Tableau to transform that raw information into something we could show to our potential investor so that they could understand things.
